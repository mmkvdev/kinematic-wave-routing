### Problem Statement
### Write two computer programs for kinematic wave routing using (a) Linear Method; (b) Non-Linear Method. Each program needs to have the following features:
* Ask the user for channel cross-section with two options to choose from: a) Rectangular section; b) Trapezoidal section
* If rectangular section is chosen, ask to input the bottom width (in m).
* If trapezoidal section is chosen, ask to input the bottom width (in m) and side slope (in degrees with vertical).
* Ask the user to input the longitudinal slope of the channel (dimensionless)
* Ask the user to input the length (L) of the channel (in m) for which the simulation has to be done
* Ask the user to input the values of x and t. (you may set some default values for this)
* Upstream boundary condition: user input hydrograph. (For intermediate times that may be required for the specified t, you may use linear interpolation)
* Use a uniform flow as the initial condition with a user specified discharge.
